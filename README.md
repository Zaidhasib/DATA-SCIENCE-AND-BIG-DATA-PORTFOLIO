### Projects 

#### 1.[Fake News Classfier](https://github.com/Zaidhasib/DATA-SCIENCE-AND-BIG-DATA-PORTFOLIO/tree/master/Fake%20News%20Classifier)

  * Created the Fake News Classifier uisng NLP techniques like BOW, Tf-Idf , Word2Vec, and then classfiy the news that are passing as a     fake or a genuine news.
  
  * Libraries used : NLTK,Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Sckit-Learn and Keras.Got an accuracy of 91%.

#### 3. [In depth Data Analysis on Airbnb data for New York area](https://github.com/Zaidhasib/DATA-SCIENCE-AND-BIG-DATA-PORTFOLIO/tree/master/Airbnb%20data%20analysis%20using%20Apache%20Spark)

  * Done data analysis of Airbnb data of April Month for New York area, performed severals transformation and action. Done EDA using         matplotlib and databricks in built plot functions. Used Spark Dataframe,Spark Sql,Spark UDF and many analytical function for             analysis.


#### 4. [Similar Question classifer on Quora datasets](https://github.com/Zaidhasib/DATA-SCIENCE-AND-BIG-DATA-PORTFOLIO/tree/master/Quora%20Similar%20Question%20Classifier)

   * Built a question classifier, which will  clasify whether the two questions are of same meaning or not. Used NLP techniques like          BOW, Tf-Idf , Word2Vec. Done features creation and features selection. For model creation used SGD. 
   
   * Libraries used : NLTK,Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Sckit-Learn

#### 5. [Neighbourhood prediction for Italian Resturant in Banglore](https://github.com/Zaidhasib/DATA-SCIENCE-AND-BIG-DATA-PORTFOLIO/tree/master/Resturant%20Location%20Recommender)

  * Built an Neighbiurhood predictor in banglore area for New Italian Resturant in radius of 12 KM area. For the data extraction used       geopy,folium. Used foursquare api for getting the details of existing retsurants. Used K-Means algorithm for segmentation.
  
  * Libraries used : Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Sckit-Learn,folium,geopy.
