### Projects 

#### 1.[Fake News Classfier](https://github.com/Zaidhasib/DATA-SCIENCE-AND-BIG-DATA-PORTFOLIO/tree/master/Fake%20News%20Classifier)

  * Created the Fake News Classifier uisng NLP techniques like BOW, Tf-Idf , Word2Vec, and then classfiy the news that are passing as a     fake or a genuine news.
  
  * Libraries used : NLTK,Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Sckit-Learn and Keras.Got an accuracy of 91%.
